# ZAP by Checkmarx Scanning Report

ZAP by [Checkmarx](https://checkmarx.com/).

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Scope of the Report
This report presents the results from the ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) security scanning tool, focusing on identifying vulnerabilities within the web application tested. The purpose is to highlight any security issues and suggest remediation strategies.

### Testing Schedule and Environment
The scanning was conducted on the web application hosted at `http://localhost:8000` using ZAP by Checkmarx. The environment was configured with default testing parameters.

### Scope of Testing
The scope includes vulnerability detection for common web application security flaws, specifically focusing on security headers, error disclosures, and MIME-sniffing protections.

### Methods and Tools Used for Testing
ZAP by Checkmarx was used to scan for vulnerabilities, including missing security headers, clickjacking protections, and error disclosures. This tool performs automated penetration testing and identifies common security issues such as cross-site scripting (XSS), data injection, and more.

## 2. Summary

### Key Findings and Recommendations
1. **Medium-Level Alerts:**
   - Ensure that the `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) header is set to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.
   - Implement the `X-Frame-Options` or `frame-ancestors` directive to protect against clickjacking attacks.
   
2. **Low-Level Alerts:**
   - Configure the application to avoid disclosing error details in the response to users. Use custom error pages that don't reveal sensitive information.
   - Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing vulnerabilities.

3. **Security Posture:**
   - The web application demonstrates a moderately secure posture, but several medium and low-level vulnerabilities need to be addressed immediately to ensure better protection against common attacks.

### General Assessment of the Systemâ€™s Security Posture
The system exhibits vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to perform XSS, clickjacking, and content-type sniffing attacks. Immediate attention is required to secure headers and manage error disclosures.

## 3. Findings and Categorization

### 1. **Medium-Level Alerts**

#### [Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)

- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Number of Instances:** 1
- **Description:** The application lacks a Content Security Policy (CSP) header. CSP helps to mitigate attacks like XSS and data injection by specifying trusted sources for content.
- **Solution:** Ensure that the web server or application server sets the CSP header with appropriate content source policies.
- **CWE Id:** [693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)
- **WASC Id:** 15
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/register`
- **Method:** GET

#### [Missing Anti-clickjacking Header](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)

- **Risk Level:** Medium
- **Number of Instances:** 1
- **Description:** The application is vulnerable to clickjacking attacks due to the absence of the `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` header.
- **Solution:** Implement either the `X-Frame-Options` header or the `frame-ancestors` directive in the CSP to prevent the application from being framed.
- **CWE Id:** [1021](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/1021.html)
- **WASC Id:** 15
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/register`
- **Method:** GET

### 2. **Low-Level Alerts**

#### [Application Error Disclosure](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90022/)

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Number of Instances:** 1
- **Description:** The page discloses error messages that could reveal sensitive information about the application, potentially leading to further attacks.
- **Solution:** Implement custom error pages and avoid revealing internal error details to users. Provide generic error messages while logging specific details server-side.
- **CWE Id:** [200](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/200.html)
- **WASC Id:** 13
- **URL:** `http://localhost:8000/register`
- **Method:** POST

#### [X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)

- **Risk Level:** Low
- **Number of Instances:** 2
- **Description:** The absence of the `X-Content-Type-Options` header allows browsers to perform MIME sniffing, potentially leading to content interpretation issues and security vulnerabilities.
- **Solution:** Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` to prevent browsers from interpreting content incorrectly.
- **CWE Id:** [693](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/693.html)
- **WASC Id:** 15
- **URLs:** 
  - `http://localhost:8000/register` 
  - `http://localhost:8000/static/styles.css`
- **Method:** GET
